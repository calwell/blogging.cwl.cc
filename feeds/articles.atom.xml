Well, a 3 hour train journey and a lot of boredom finally pushed me to just make the switch and to write a short post about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="what-is-a-statically-generated-website"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a statically generated website?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Compared to dynamic web pages, where the web page is rendered by server-side logic and usually require a database, with statically generated websites you feed files written in a markup language like Markdown, reStructuredText, Textile, etc. to a static site generator which spits them out as a static website that is ready for deployment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are useful when the content doesn't vary based on parameters provided by a user, like in the case of a personal web page where the content is delivered to the user exactly as it was stored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
